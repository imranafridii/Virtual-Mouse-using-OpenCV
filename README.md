Project Title: AI Virtual Mouse Control 🖱️🤖Description:This project is a Computer Vision-based Virtual Mouse that allows users to control their computer cursor and perform clicks using hand gestures. By leveraging the MediaPipe framework (via cvzone) and OpenCV, the system tracks hand landmarks in real-time, mapping finger movements to screen coordinates and pinch gestures to mouse clicks.Key Features:Touchless Control: Move the cursor without touching a physical mouse.Real-time Hand Tracking: Uses the HandTrackingModule for high-precision finger detection.Gesture-based Clicking: Perform a left-click by pinching the thumb and index finger together.Smooth Navigation: Automatically scales camera coordinates to match your monitor's resolution.Technical Stack:Python: Core programming language.OpenCV: For image processing and webcam feed handling.cvzone: A wrapper for MediaPipe to simplify hand landmark detection.PyAutoGUI: To programmatically control the mouse cursor and click events.How it Works:Hand Landmark Detection: The script identifies 21 unique points on the hand. We specifically track Point 8 (Index finger tip) and Point 4 (Thumb tip).Coordinate Mapping: The $(x, y)$ position of the index finger is mapped from the webcam frame size to the user's screen resolution using pyautogui.size().Distance Calculation: The distance between the thumb and index finger is calculated.If the distance is less than 40 pixels, a click is triggered.A "de-bounce" logic (using the clicking boolean) is used to prevent multiple clicks at once.
